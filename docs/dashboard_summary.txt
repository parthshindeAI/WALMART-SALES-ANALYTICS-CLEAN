1️⃣ Executive Summary (3–4 sentences)
Walmart generated $160.3M in total sales, with an average weekly sales value of ~$16.0K per record, indicating stable baseline demand across the network. Store 10 significantly outperformed peers with $7.72M in sales, while Store 33 underperformed, signaling execution or demand-side issues. Sales show a strong seasonal spike in Q4, peaking in December 2010, followed by softer volatility through 2011–2012. Overall performance is solid, but inconsistency across stores and months limits full upside.

2️⃣ Key Insights (3)
1. Seasonality is a major revenue driver: Consistent sales spikes in November–December indicate strong holiday dependence and predictable demand surges.
2. Store-level performance gap is wide: The top-performing store materially outpaces the weakest, pointing to uneven operational efficiency or local demand capture.
3. Post-peak volatility persists: After seasonal highs, sales fail to stabilize at elevated levels, suggesting missed retention or post-holiday conversion opportunities.

3️⃣ Risks (2)
1. Over-reliance on seasonal revenue increases exposure to demand shocks during non-peak months.
2. Underperforming stores drag network efficiency, diluting gains from high-performing locations.

4️⃣ Recommended Actions (2)
1. Replicate Store 10 best practices (inventory mix, staffing, promotions) across mid- and low-performing stores to lift baseline performance.
2. Introduce targeted off-season promotions and localized demand strategies to smooth revenue volatility and reduce dependence on Q4 spikes.
